Face Mesh Detection OpenCV Python




In today's episode, we will see how Face Mesh Detection can be done using Python OpenCV directly via an Image file, webcam or video file.


First of all you need to install OpenCV and Numpy. We will do this tutorial using the completed Python programming language so let's get started.

MediaPipe works with research and developers' solutions and applications for machine learning in mobile, web applications, edge computing, etc.

MediaPipe  processes an RGB image and returns pose landmarks on the most prominent person detected.  Please refer to usage examples.

Import CV2, mediapipe, and time.
To install mediapipe 
        pip install mediapipe

OpenCV is an image processing library. It is designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV is a C/C++ library that is extended in Python.
